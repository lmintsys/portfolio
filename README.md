# portfolio
## Description
The aim of this project was to create a portfolio which would showcase my work and provide my contact information to a potential hiring manager. The portfolio includes a short paragraph about myself, links to my previous deployed projects and to my resume, contact info, and a navigation menu for an easier access.
Working on this project, provided me with a valuable knowledge on building and organizing a webpage with HTML and styling the HTML elements using CSS. 
## Installation

n/a

## Usage
A user can navigate through the protfolio using the navigation menu at the top right corner. By clicking on each of the projects' photos, they will be taken to a deployed webpage of each project. At the moment, only one project is available - the Horiseon Code Reafactor. When clicking on the Resume from the navigation menu, the pdf file will open in a new window.
